/*
 * An email needs to be sent to all account owners
 * Pretend your server received a request with the query below. It contains all the info needed
 * to build requests to other endpoints.
 *
 const queryString = '/status-email?accountId=8675309&accountsEndpoint=account&usersEndpoint=user&emailEndpoint=sendGrid';
 *
 * Given this request (queryString), create a
 * function (or set of functions) that parses the initial query string and builds the
 * requests queue and handles requesting the endpoints
 *
 * Put your answer on your GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab or some other place where
 * it can be seen. Reply to this email with a link to your answer.

 * Hint:
 * The requests that you'll build, once parsed from the original url, will look like this:
 * GET https://safe-beyond-14033.herokuapp.com/<accountsEndpoint>/<accountId>
 * (You'll need to parse the endpoint's real value out of the queryString. i.e. accountsEndpoint=account)

  This endpoint returns account info like this:
  { status: 'ACTIVE', users: [123456, 123457, 123458] }

  Your next set of requests will look like this:
  GET https://safe-beyond-14033.herokuapp.com/<usersEndpoint>/<userId>
  This endpoint returns user info per user
  (remember, you're getting data for multiple users) that looks like this:
  { userId: 123456, firstName: 'Biff', lastName: 'Tannen', email: 'biff@biffsautodetailing.com }

  Finally, you're ready to POST to the sendGrid endpoint
 * POST https://safe-beyond-14033.herokuapp.com/<emailEndpoint>
  POST Body: {
    accountStatus: 'ACTIVE',
    users: [
      { firstName: 'mike', email: 'mike@tyson.com' },
      { firstName: 'george', email: 'george@thegrilla.com'}
    ]
  }

 * Note: one or more requests can be made in parallel.
